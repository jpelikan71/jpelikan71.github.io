Model creating process traditionally used to study the properties and to make predictions of behavior (dynamics) of various systems, both natural and artificial. Model is built on the basis of a certain set of measurements of system individual characteristics.

Based on any theoretical approaches applicable to this system, one can try to obtain a formal description of the structure and (or) dynamics of this system, for example, as a set of mathematical equations describing the relationships between the parameters of the system under study. Such a model may be used for description of rather complex systems and phenomena (for example, temperature distribution over the surface of an object; exchange and transformation reactions of substances in a living cell; mechanical deformations when processing a part, etc.).
