### Early years

I'v been studied in Moscow State forestrey University, 
Department of electronics and systems technology, 
which prepared stuff for nearby space industry in Russian space center in Korolev city.
There I've received my Ph.D for the Thesis about methods of processing of satellite imagery containing objects with anomalies.

### Working experience in industry

I spent several years working in the area of R&D and consulting in IT, developing information systems projects 
for engineering and R&D companies (systems for modelling, automatic measurement, testing...).

### R&D experience

In 2011 I joined "CTT group" company, partaker of number of interesing R&D projects in such areas as remote sensing; 
lab experiments measurements processing; engineering systems modelling and testing...

Current work requires elaborating new algorithms and technologies, so I need to nave a strong theoretical background 
in the area of complex data processing.

So, last years I'm working with strong cooperation with Artificial Intelligence Research Center of Program Systems Institute of Russian Academy of Siences (Pereslavl).
