### Early years

I'v been studied in Moscow State forestrey University, 
Department of electronics and systems technology, 
which prepared stuff for nearby space industry in Russian space center in Korolev city.
There I've received my Ph.D for the Thesis about methods of processing of satellite imagery containing objects with anomalies.

### R&D experience

Trying to go deeper in theory of new algorithms and technologies of complex data processing , I'm trying to be involved in interesting research projects which leads to new results and articles. As a researcher I joined a lab in well-known Dorodnicyn Computing Centre
of RAS.

For practice in applied areas, in 2011 I joined "CTT group" company, partaker of number of interesing R&D projects in such areas as remote sensing; lab experiments measurements processing; engineering systems modelling and testing etc.
