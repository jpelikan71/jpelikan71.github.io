Abstract
======
Most of real-life processes and phenomenons, natural or anthropogenic, micro- or macroscopic, that anyone wants to explore and use, are so complex that for today they can't be described analytically.

Researchers can use probabilistic approach to characterise that matters. Such approximation, nevetherless, will be quite coarse when the intrinsic nature of investigated proccess/object is determinisic in fact. In addition, it may be difficult or even impossible to infer probabilistic distribution in analytic form for most real-life object properties.

Another way to create a model of complex object/process is so-called phenomenological approach. Going here, we are constructing some numerical model that is most relevant to correlations between observed object characteristics, wehrein it may be no information about nature and origin of those correlations.

Learning from Data
======
Methods and algorithms of Data Learning realized as computer tools give us possibility to model some complex object charactreristics and behaviour leaning on sets of data about object measurements. We now have such a powerful tool as Deep Neural Networks
