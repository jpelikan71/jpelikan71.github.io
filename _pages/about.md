Abstract
======
Most of real-life processes and phenomenons, natural or anthropogenic, micro- or macroscopic, that anyone wants to explore and use, are so complex that for today they can't be described analytically.

Researchers can use probabilistic approach to characterise that matters. Such approximation, nevetherless, will be quite coarse when the intrinsic nature of investigated proccess/object is determinisic in fact. In addition, it may be difficult or even impossible to infer probabilistic distribution in analytic form for most real-life object properties.

Another way to create a model of complex object/process is so-called phenomenological approach. Going this way, we are constructing some numerical model that is most relevant to correlations between observed object characteristics, wehrein it may be no information about nature and origin of those correlations.

Learning from Data
======
Methods and algorithms of Data Learning realized as computer tools give us possibility to model some complex object charactreristics and behaviour leaning on sets of data about object measurements. Having such a powerful tool as Deep Neural Networks one can try to explore characteristics of very fancy phenomenons like speech, music, images, video, biological enities, etc. that have no strict and full analytic exposion in mathematical formulations for today.

Probabilty and Determinism
======
Modelling some matter with Data Learning methods is based, in fact, on modelling some probabilty distributions of its basis features, natural ot synthetic. At the same time some complex structures that look like "random noise" have deterministic origin in reality (this phenomenin is known as "deterministic chaos") or deterministic interactions between each other. Could we distinguish random and deterministic origin, what opportinities gives such a knowledge, will be data learning more tractable cosidering such a determinism?

Applications
======
*All theory, dear friend, is grey, but the golden tree of actual life springs ever green*.
What really practical one can do with all that machunery right now?
Let's try some things that would be really joyfull.
